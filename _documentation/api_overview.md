Welcome to our Doc Portal.

This API Overview is intended to help plan and integrate with the BOIPA Gateway APIs.

Our API is always under development and will evolve.

If you are capturing data in your application or website you can send it to our Direct API to be processed.
This is best suited if you want to manage the full transaction life cycle using the API, from initial payment through to settlement and additional actions like refunds and voids.

Our Cashier is our PCI DSS v3.2 compliant hosted solution, allowing the capture of card data without the PCI overhead associated with a Direct API integration.

The BOIPA Gateway can also provide and manage Alternate Payment Methods (APM) integrations with the APM providers, returning transaction results to the merchantsâ€™ systems. <br>
In some, instances, the merchant will have been required to register accounts with these APM providers, and to supply their credentials to the IPG Gateway, where the data is stored securely and confidentially.
